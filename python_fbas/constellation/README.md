# Constellation

In this package we provide functionality related to Constellation overlays.

Constellation is described in an upcoming FC 2025 paper.

## Installation

Start in the top-level directory (i.e., the grand-parent of the directory this file belongs to).
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Next, run `pip install .` (or `pip install -e .` to keep updated during development).
Finally, go to `python_fbas/constellation/brute-force-search/` and run `make install` (note this calls the gcc compiler).

## Examples

To compute the Constellation clusters when there are 200 organizations where 100 have threshold 130 and 100 have threshold 140, try
```
constellation compute-clusters --thresholds 100 130 100 140 --max-num-clusters=5 --min-cluster-size=33
```

As the number of different thresholds increases, the search space increases a log.
To keep runtime low, we need to reduce the maximal number of clusters allowed and increase the minimal cluster size.
For example:
```
constellation compute-clusters --thresholds 50 130 50 135 50 140 50 145 --max-num-clusters=3 --min-cluster-size=60
```

To compute the Constellation overlay graph give a single-universe, regular FBAS in JSON format:
```
constellation compute-overlay --fbas data/10_orgs_single_univ.json --output overlay.json
```
